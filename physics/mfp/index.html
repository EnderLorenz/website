        <h3>Theoretical Calculation</h3>
          In this problem the average number of particles per unity area is &sigma; = 0.005m<sup>-2</sup> 
          and average radius of a particle is R = 1m.
          So, what is the average length l that an arrow will travel?
          The effective cross section of a collision is 2R since this is a two dimensional problem 
          and the arrow is infintely thin. So, <br>
          l = 1/(2R&sigma;) = 1/(2*1m*0.005m<sup>-2</sup>) = 100m.
        <h3>Simulation</h3>
          In order to save computation time, the simulation only uses 1/4 of the unit circle.
          Thus, the number of trees is &pi;r<sup>2</sup>/4*0.005. Here, r = 900m is the radius of the forrest.
          The trees are "planted" using a random number between 0-900 for each x and y.  As objects in the program, a forrest
          consists of trees. Tree's data consists of their x and y locations, their distances and they have the 
          functionality of being able to draw themselves.
          In order to have an even distribution in the quarter circle, trees are replanted until their radius is 
          less than or equal to 900m.  Other seemingly crafty methods will result in an uneven distribution.
          Using a shape other than a circle will skew the results. 
          Next, The arrow is "shot" at a random angle which is chosen by a random number between 0-&pi;/2.
          After the arrow is "shot" the angle is used to determine the equation of a line with the given angle,
          m = tan(&theta;) -> y = mx since the arrow starts at the origin.  The arrow object keeps track of is angle,
          slope, hit distance and has a function for a line and the ability to draw itself.
          Then, the program loops through every tree to see if the arrow hit a tree.  In order to do this we use the equation
          of a circle (x - h)<sup>2</sup>+ (y-k)<sup>2</sup> = r<sup>2</sup>. Where h is the x coordinate, k is the y coordinate,
          and r = 1 is the radius of the tree.  We now have two equations and two unknowns.
          Since I'm not a fan of math and I like to know I have the right answer, I use mathematica.
          <br> 
          Try this:<br><br>
          Clear["Global`*"] <br>
          Solve[r*r == (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 && y == m*x + b, {x, y}] // FullSimplify<br>
          which gives: <br>
          {{x -> (h - b m + k m - Sqrt[-(b - k + h m)^2 + (1 + m^2) r^2])/(1 + m^2), y -> (b + m (h + k m - Sqrt[-(b - k + h m)^2 + (1 + m^2) r^2]))/(1 + m^2)}, <br>
          {x -> (h - b m + k m + Sqrt[-(b - k + h m)^2 + (1 + m^2) r^2])/(1 + m^2), y -> (b + m (h + k m + Sqrt[-(b - k + h m)^2 + (1 + m^2) r^2]))/(1 + m^2)}}. <br>
          <br> Now, setting b = 0, r = 1, and taking the first solution since it is closer to the origin in this problem: <br><br>
          Clear["Global`*"] <br>
          b = 0; <br>
          r = 1; <br>
          First[FullSimplify[Solve[r*r == (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 && y == m*x + b, {x, y}]]] <br>
          which gives: <br>
          {x -> (h + k m - Sqrt[1 - (k + m - h m) (k - (1 + h) m)])/(1 + m^2), y -> (m (h + k m - Sqrt[1 - (k + m - h m) (k - (1 + h) m)]))/(1 + m^2)}
          <br><br>
          Great! Now, we need to analyze the value inside the square root, &delta; = 1 - (k + m - h m) (k - (1 + h) m), first.  
          If &delta; < 0 then there is no collision.
          If &delta; = 0 then the line is tangent.
          If &delta; > 0 then we have a collsion, compute the coordinates using the above equations and calculate the distance.
          Now, we need to make sure we check all the trees but, while many may hit we only want the closest.  The mean, &mu;, is calculated
          as we go along by simply adding the result for each arrow to a variable and dividing by the total number of arrows shot so far.
          One hundred arrows are shot in each forrest. Then, the forrest is "replanted".
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        In order to graph the data, the hit distances are first binned using a binwidth of ten meters.  
        If it so happens that an arrow did not hit any trees its hit distances is taken as 10 + the last bin.
        For example, if two arrows escape, the first hit distance is 910 meters and the second is 920 meters.
        Using this method we are able to simulate a background count on top of the random noise inherent in generation
        if random numbers for the tree locations and arrow slope.
        Binning the data we see what looks like an exponential curve.  Using a weighted least sqaures fit we
        can see an interesting result.
